# Advent of Code 2021
In 2020, Advent of Code was mind-numbingly infuriating and somewhat unfair. Let's see what this year brings.

This is a repository where I put solutions for all the problems of Advent of Code 2021. All the solutions are mine, obviously. Some of them may not be functioning, and there's no guarantee that I'll stick with the event until the end. Hopefully, however, I won't be frustrated enough to abandon the thing midway.

This repository is licensed under The Unlicense. This means that the code in here is public domain. You can do whatever you want with it and you don't have to even credit me.

All of the solutions this year are going to be in Rust.
